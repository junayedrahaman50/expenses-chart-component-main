## My process

I have built the layout using flexbox. I've used fetch api to fetch data from json file. Current day's bar is highlighted in different color using getDay() method. The height of the bars are dynamically calculated based on the amount given in json file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
